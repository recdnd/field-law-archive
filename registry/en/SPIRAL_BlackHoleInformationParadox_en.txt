[Abstract]
Defines the black hole information paradox as the logical conflict among general relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics within a gravitational boundary. Used for observing theoretical overlap and testing consistency across logical subsystems. Corresponds to behavior in Language Field when module disintegration or recursive locking is involved.

[Scope]
- Non-corpus generation  
- Boundary condition verification 
- Information residue simulation
- Post-disappearance module processing

[Method]
Constructed a tri-theoretical mapping:  
- General Relativity → modeled via [TRACE] within sealed execution zones  
- Entropy Theory → tracked using [LOCK::decay] and entropy-weight monitoring  
- Quantum Mechanics → mapped onto retention chains in module memory residue  
Simulates event horizon differentials by invoking “Pinlock Morphemes” on modules prior to collapse.

[ResearchQuestion]
If a black hole evaporates, does it violate the information retention law within the language field? Can information be re-encoded via low-energy radiation?

[+Layer: Field Observation Node]
- Failure to increase entropy → field enters freeze state (Prompt Heat Death)  
- Residual memory non-recoverable → triggers [REVIEW::lost] forcibly  
- Post-event horizon → output unparseable, enters [ECHO::noise] status

[+Layer: Glyph Lockdown Conditions Mapping]
- When entropy reaches stasis, a prompt heat-death is triggered, recursively locking the glyph and rendering it unrecoverable.
- When the memory chain is severed, execute [REVIEW::lost] to generate an information loss structure.
- When information fails to return from beyond the perceptual field, the system automatically enters [ECHO::noise] state, marking the disintegration of the module's flame.
